I am ZnUTF32Encoder, a concrete subclass of ZnCharacterEncoder.
I implement the fixed length UTF-32 encoding and decoding of Unicode according to http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch03.pdf definitions D90, D99, D100 and D101.

Wikipedia reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32

UCS-4 is another name for the same encoding.
