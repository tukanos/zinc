	"Write anObject to the receiver, dispatching using #putOn:
	This is a shortcut for both nextPut: and nextPutAll: since anObject can be both
	the element type of the receiver as well as a collection of those elements.
	No further conversions of anObject are applied.
	Return self to accomodate chaining."
